There are many columns in this dataset. You can see how many by typing ncol(outcome) (you can see the number of rows with the nrow function). In addition, you can see the names of each column by typing names(outcome) (the names are also in the PDF document.

To make a simple histogram of the 30-day death rates from heart attack (column 11 in the outcome dataset), run

> outcome[, 11] <- as.numeric(outcome[, 11])
> ## You may get a warning about NAs being introduced; that is okay
> hist(outcome[, 11])

Write a function called best that take two arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state and an outcome name. The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the best (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specified outcome in that state. The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. The outcomes can be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.

The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid state value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid state”. If an invalid outcome value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome”.

Here is some sample output from the function.
> source("best.R")
> best("TX", "heart attack")
[1] "CYPRESS FAIRBANKS MEDICAL CENTER"
> best("TX", "heart failure")
[1] "FORT DUNCAN MEDICAL CENTER"
> best("MD", "heart attack")
[1] "JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL, THE"
> best("MD", "pneumonia")
[1] "GREATER BALTIMORE MEDICAL CENTER"
> best("BB", "heart attack")
Error in best("BB", "heart attack") : invalid state
> best("NY", "hert attack")
Error in best("NY", "hert attack") : invalid outcome
>

Write a function called rankhospital that takes three arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state (state), an outcome (outcome), and the ranking of a hospital in that state for that outcome (num). The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the ranking specified by the num argument. For example, the call

rankhospital("MD", "heart failure", 5)

would return a character vector containing the name of the hospital with the 5th lowest 30-day death rate for heart failure. The num argument can take values “best”, “worst”, or an integer indicating the ranking (smaller numbers are better). If the number given by num is larger than the number of hospitals in that state, then the function should return NA. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
> source("rankhospital.R")
> rankhospital("TX", "heart failure", 4)
[1] "DETAR HOSPITAL NAVARRO"
> rankhospital("MD", "heart attack", "worst")
[1] "HARFORD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"
> rankhospital("MN", "heart attack", 5000)
[1] NA

Write a function called rankall that takes two arguments: an outcome name (outcome) and a hospital rank- ing (num). The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a 2-column data frame containing the hospital in each state that has the ranking specified in num. For example the function call rankall("heart attack", "best") would return a data frame containing the names of the hospitals that are the best in their respective states for 30-day heart attack death rates. The function should return a value for every state (some may be NA). The first column in the data frame is named hospital, which contains the hospital name, and the second column is named state, which contains the 2-character abbreviation for the state name. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.

The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid outcome value is passed to rankall, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome”. The num variable can take values “best”, “worst”, or an integer indicating the ranking (smaller numbers are better). If the number given by num is larger than the number of hospitals in that state, then the function should return NA.
